# Qtum Revive
Add Revive network as an off-chain solution to the [Qtum](https://github.com/qtumproject)

Changing the cryptocurrencies transcation problems by reblancing. 
Offering a safe way to mitigate some of the possible
skewness that may arise in a payment network.

1. Instant Payments.  
Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds.

2. Scalability.  
Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.

3. Low Cost.  
By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Revive Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.
4. Atomic Enforceability.  
 When using Revive to improve the routing of future payments within a network, the optimal solution under such a denition would therefore be one that eliminates the most skewness in the network where possible.
